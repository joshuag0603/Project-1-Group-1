# <Snack-and-Movie-Recommender>

https://joshuag0603.github.io/movieNsnackinator/index.html

## Description

This website was created for people who are overwhelmed with choices for deciding what movie to watch. The website provides a movie and snack recommendation from the movies and snacks the user adds to their library. We built this project because it allowed us to demonstrate specific applications of coding skills we have gained. During this project we learned the basics of using the Bootstrap CSS framework, how to create and deploy branches for shared repo in Github, and some of the intricacies of functions in Javascript and their logic. The project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

![Recommendation Modal](assets/images/recommendationModal.png)

The website's Home Page has two input forms to add Movies and Snacks into the browser's local storage. One movie/snack must be entered at a time and the form will display an error message if no movie or snack is added into the input field. The user must click the button below the input field for the movie/snack to be added to local storage. The third button at the bottom of the page outputs a random snack and movie from local storage and displays them in a modal on the screen.

The Inventory Page shows two lists, one for the movies you added and one for the snacks you added. These are pulled from the browser's local storage. You can remove movies and snacks individually, clear out an entire single list, or clear out both lists at once. There are modals that pop up to confirm you want to clear out the entire list.
